# DSA-Assignment
For this project our team has been tasked with designing and creating an efficient music player algorithm for a mobile application.
By using the knowladge and skills we've learned thus far we have been able to implemented the following functions as required for this assignment:
We have implemented the ability for the user to play both the next song and the previous song through the use of a doubly linkedlist.
The user will be able to play any song on repeat by use of a repeat option.
The user can both add and remove songs from their playlist.
Finally the user can also search for a specific song they wish to play. The search function makes use of binary search and a quicksort function is run to organise the data before the search is commenced.
